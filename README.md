Script for quick&dirty satellite array detection based on previous reference and annotaion.
Options explained at ./det_sat.py --help 
Tested only with CHM13 annotation, but should work for other ones. Can be used for relative species, i.e. for primates on human annotation, but results never checked.

CHM13 reference and annotation can be taken from https://github.com/marbl/CHM13
