Script for quick&dirty satellite array detection based on previous reference and annotation.
For options description see ./det_sat.py --help 

Tested only with CHM13 annotation, but should work for other ones. Can be used for relative species, i.e. for primates on human annotation, but results never checked.
Not intended to work on repeat subfamilies.

CHM13 reference and annotation can be taken from https://github.com/marbl/CHM13
